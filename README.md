- Hack4Split is annual entrepreneurial competition which allows people to try their best in making their ideas become reality.
- It also encourages team workflows, workshops and other. 

## About project
- During 2 days of competition my team and I created this beautiful app which allows users to find adrenaline fullfilled attractions much easier.
- Data has been scraped off the web and for now remains the same as shown in git repository.

## Technologies
- For creation of this project we used:
- React.js
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- C# (Backend)

## My part in given project
- For duration of competition I have done frontend where everything you find will be responsive and functional as an hardcoded project.
- There are still changes to make, same stands for backend since it isn't possible to do much for both in 24 hours

## Folders
- hackaton folder is where whole frontend is placed.
- hack3splitBORBAapi_Bartul is where you will find the newest backend written.
- Data folder contains dummy data that has been passed via backend to render out cards.
- backup_files contain 2 filese where PasswordHasher.cs hashes the given password and saves it into the database.
- UserModelDTOForLogin.cs is a model for getting persons username and password.
